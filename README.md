# spaghettify
Take your pretty java code and make it ugly

Usage:
Insert script in folder with file input.txt, in which put your code. Then use script (python3 spaghettify.py in bash or whatever).
Script will make file output.txt in the same directory.

This script doesn't support comments that aren't basic two backslash (//), so if there is some fancy comment in code
output will be incorrect.
