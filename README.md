# spaghettify
Take your pretty java code and make it ugly

Usage:
Use script (python3 spaghettify.py in bash or whatever), then input file path (it can be relative or absolut path, including ~/file).
Note that this script doesn't work on python2.

Script will make file output.txt in the directory it is located.

Enjoy!
